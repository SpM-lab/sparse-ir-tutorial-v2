## Author guideline

* In Markdown cells, use the `$$`, `$$ $$` environments for equations.
* References are listed in the markdown cell at the bottom of each notebook.
* Remove all outputs in a jupyter notebook.

## Build html files

```

Then, you can upload html files to the repository by running the following command:
